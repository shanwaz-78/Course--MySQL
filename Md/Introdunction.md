|---    |---    |---            |
|Bucky  |25     |Shephard       |
|Lisa   |68     |Magician       |
|Tony   |21     |Student        |

* Now You Can see we took a table with each colum with a specific category like Name,Age,Profession.

* We Have Name Category and put the all names in Name Category and similarly did this job into Age and Profession Category.

* And you can see the first entry which has Bucky and age is 25 and profession is shephard.
